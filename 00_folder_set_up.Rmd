```

This script will generate the base folders required for the PEM project. 
Run this script first, You will need to name the aoi only.

Note when naming AOI avoid spaces, and use capitals to distinguish between names if desired. i.e DateCreek or WilliamsLake or KootenayLake


```{r}

source("./_functions/setup_folder_structure.R")


# specify the name of the study area
AOI <- "KIC_SE"

# run the function
setupfolders(AOI)


```


You will need to save the base data in the following folders: 

1) AOI - save to : "NAMEOFAOI_AOI/0_raw_inputs/base_layers/"
2) RAW LIDAR - save to: "NAMEORAOI_AOI/0_raw_inputs/dem/

Note if you have more up to date data for Base lasyers than those available through the BC data catalogue (ie. Bec Layers) save them in the base_layers folder.
