#### A bit about this script:
# The main idea is to clump together cells in a raster that are similar in close
# proximity to each other so that the raster is despeckled and then 
# after that polygonizing occurs. I've tried finding different resources for
# creating a smooth polygon output, but it was to no avail - the best solution
# remains using GRASS GIS so no matter what, this script requires GRASS to be 
# installed on your machine. This should be taken care of in the script, 
# though it's currently limited to a Windows operating system.

# There are 3 options (clean_levels) for producing the final output. Before
# starting any of the options, SAGA GIS is used to despeckle the raster using
# a built in toolchain. Next, the options are carried out:

# 1. clean_level 1, or the lowest amount of cleaning. Using GRASS, the clumped
# raster is imported and polygonized (a smoothing option is applied in the 
# polygonize step here). Next, the polygon is smoothed and cleaned.

# 2/3. clean_level 2/3, or medium/high cleaning. After the clumped raster is made, the 
# stars package is used to polygonize the raster (note: stars uses the 
# gdal_polygonize algorithm here, makes it fairly efficient). The output polygon
# is blocky from the raster, so it then gets simplified using Andy Teucher's 
# rmapshaper package (the polygon is topologically correct!). This polygon is
# loaded into GRASS where it is then smoothed and cleaned. The difference 
# between clean level 2 and 3 is the option in the ms_simplify function
# "keep_shapes". Keeping all the shapes will result in longer processing times
# but look more similar to the clumped raster. Not keeping the shapes is the 
# fastest option of all options here, but may provide too much cleaning to the 
# final polygon.
