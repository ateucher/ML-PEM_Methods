# # Part 2: Stratified random sampling of wetlands  ---------------------------------------------
# 
# # lets now create a random sample of wetlands 
# # the criteria we want to work with 
# #       - wetlands must be within X distance to a road
# #       - create random points within the bec zones ( ) 
# #       - dont want to sample where we already have data
# 
# 
# # lets create a buffer around the roads and then determine which points fall within the 
# # buffer 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# # we can now eliminate any points that have already been sampled - lets buffer out sites by 500m 
# # to ensure no overlap with new points 
# 
# plot_exclude <- st_buffer(plot, dist = 500)
# 
# overlap_pts <- st_intersection(waterpt, plot_exclude)
# 
# waterpt <- waterpt %>%
#   filter(!WATERBODY_POLY_ID %in% overlap_pts$WATERBODY_POLY_ID)
# 
# 
# # We can now randomly select using the bec types to stratify first let us intersect the 
# # point to add the bec zone name and id
# 
# bec_pts <- st_intersection(waterpt, bec_sf)
# 
# # make a list of unique bec variants 
# bgc.ls <- as.list(unique(bec_pts$MAP_LABEL))
# 
# 
# 
# 
# # write out as csv   
# 
# write.csv(out, file = "demo/wetland_sample.csv")
# 
# 
# # Write out a KML file ----------------------------------------------------
# 
# # Now we can write out a KML file so we can 
# # view this is google earth. First we need to convert to a sp object.
